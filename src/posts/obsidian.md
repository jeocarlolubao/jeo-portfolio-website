Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files.[2][3] It allows users to make internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a graph.[4][5] It is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way. The software is free for personal use, with commercial licenses available for pay.[2][6]

Obsidian was founded by Shida Li and Erica Xu while quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic.[7] Li and Xu, who had met while studying at the University of Waterloo, had already collaborated on several development projects.[8] Obsidian was initially released on 30 March 2020.[9] Version 1.0.0 was released in October 2022.[10][11] Version 1.1, which added the Canvas core plugin, released in December 2022.[12]

Obsidian is built on Electron.[6] It is a cross-platform application that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, as well as mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS.[6] There is no web-based version of the software.[8] Obsidian on all platforms can be customized by adding plugins and themes, which enable users to extend the software's functionality with additional features or integration with other tools.[6] Obsidian differentiates between core plugins, which are released and maintained by the Obsidian team, and community plugins, which are open-sourced through GitHub and are contributed by users.[13] Examples of community plugins include a Kanban-style task board and a calendar widget.[3] There are over 200 community made themes to use with the app.

Obsidian operates on a folder of text documents; each new note in Obsidian generates a new text document, and all the documents can be searched from within the app.[6][3] Obsidian allows internal linking between notes and creates an interactive graph that visualizes the relationships between notes.[6][8][3] Text formatting in Obsidian is achieved through Markdown, but Obsidian provides the instantaneous previewing of formatted text.[6]

Obsidian's customer support is accessible only through email.[8] The developers, however, have hosted an Internet forum and a Discord channel where users can exchange solutions and ideas.[8]
