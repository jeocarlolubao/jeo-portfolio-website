SvelteKit is a modern web framework that builds on the principles of the Svelte framework, aiming to simplify the process of building efficient and performant web applications. Developed by the creators of Svelte, SvelteKit provides a higher-level abstraction for routing, navigation, and project structure, making it easier for developers to create dynamic and interactive web experiences. It embraces a file-system-based routing approach, where each route corresponds to a file in the project directory, facilitating a clean and intuitive project structure. SvelteKit also includes built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR), client-side rendering (CSR), and static site generation (SSG), offering flexibility in how developers choose to optimize their applications for speed and search engine visibility. The framework prioritizes developer experience, enabling efficient development with minimal boilerplate while leveraging the power of Svelte's compiler to generate highly optimized and lightweight JavaScript code for the browser.
