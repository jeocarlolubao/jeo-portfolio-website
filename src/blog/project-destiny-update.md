Hello Everyone! I would like to share some annoucements regarding Project DESTINY.
</div>
<br>
 <div style="text-align: justify">
In case you missed it, <a href="https://github.com/jeoooo/PROJECTDESTINY" target="_blank">Project DESTINY</a> serves as a centralized directory for checking the uptime of websites and student portals of various educational institutions, offering a convenient and single point of access for users across Davao City. Its main goal is to provide a centralized directory for educators and students to check if their school's website is up.

<br>
<br>
 <div style="text-align: justify">
An upcoming change in Project DESTINY's backend infrastructure that will affect data management processes. While this may not sound particularly thrilling, I want to assure you that this transition is essential for enhancing the platform's performance and streamlining operations. Here's what you need to know:

<br>
 <div style="text-align: justify">
 As the sole developer behind this project, I am continuously exploring ways to improve the platform's efficiency and user experience. In this spirit, I am announcing a temporary transition from Pocketbase to a pure JSON format for our backend data.

<div style="text-align: justify">
While this may not sound particularly thrilling, I want to assure you that this transition is essential for enhancing the platform's performance and streamlining operations. Here's what you need to know:
</div>
<br>
<ol >
    <li><strong>1. Simplified Data Management:</strong> <br> By moving to a pure JSON format, I will be able to simplify the management of our data, allowing for more efficient maintenance and updates. </li><br>
    <li><strong>2. Greater Flexibility:</strong> <br> JSON offers greater flexibility in handling and manipulating data, providing me with the agility to adapt to your evolving needs and implement improvements more effectively. </li><br>
    <li><strong>3. Expected Performance Improvements:</strong> <br> While not as exhilarating as some updates, this transition is expected to lead to improved performance, resulting in faster access to information and a smoother user experience overall. </li><br>
    <li><strong>4. Continued Transparency:</strong> <br> I believe in keeping you informed about any changes to the platform. Transparency is important to me, and I want to ensure you are aware of the steps we are taking to enhance Project DESTINY. </li><br>
    <li><strong>5. Streamlined Contributions: </strong> <br> With the transition to a pure JSON format, contributing to Project DESTINY has never been easier. Previously, using Pocketbase required accessing an admin dashboard, which could be cumbersome. Now, users can view and contribute directly from the JSON itself, making the process more accessible and efficient for everyone involved. This streamlined approach fosters greater collaboration and empowers users to actively participate in the improvement of the platform without unnecessary barriers. </li><br>
</ol>

 <div style="text-align: justify">
Instructions on how to contribute will be also be updated. I understand that changes like this can raise questions or concerns. Please feel free to reach out to me with any queries or feedback you may have regarding this transition. Your input is invaluable as I work to refine and improve Project DESTINY.

<br> 
<br> 
 <div style="text-align: justify">
I'm excited to share that a new user interface (UI) is already in the works for Project DESTINY. This update aims to enhance the platform's usability and aesthetics, providing a more intuitive experience for all users.
