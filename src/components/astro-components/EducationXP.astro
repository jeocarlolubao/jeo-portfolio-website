      This library relies on the usage of <strong>semantic HTML</strong>. To make a button, you'll need
      to use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on
      <code>aria-label</code>. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary
      goal of this project.
